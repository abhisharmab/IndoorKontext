Kontext - Location + iBeacon Based University Information Services Mobile Application
=====================================================================================

Kontext iOS Application was the first stepping stone towards my entreprenueiral idea/endeavour. This application provide useful notifications and information about current display events/lectures in a particular building. The use-case was imagined in an university setting where students/professors/scholars would be notified about "interesting" events in a particular building as they enter that building. This is micro location based service so lot pervasive applications can be created out of this.
